Present
Not a mushroom was autumn, not a mushroom at all. In the cold dry forest mushrooms did not even smell. In the forest - to the edges, to the spacious blue skies. I took it from habit - to grab somewhere interesting, like a little man or animal, root, throw a bright ruby bunch of viburnum.
I wanted everything to be in order.
And suddenly he was on his guard - from somewhere pulled by a sudden pleasant dampness. I looked around.
In the middle of the path there made a little strong little pig! Here is another one! And there is a weighty boletus on the side of the road, and then a boletus and a flywheel, and a brown grape. Good luck! For a minute, I sat down to rest and enjoy the heavy basket. Light noise. Look at me with stripes on the back - whether weasel, or chipmunk, and next to the squirrel.
I came to my senses. Look how many forest people feed here! Sometimes I left a fungus or a piece of bread on the road. The animals will be useful!
